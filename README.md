# BusinessAnalytics

This predictive analytics project focused on predicting the outcome of a bank's direct marketing campagin.  I utilized decision tree, k-NN, and logistic regression methods to predict customer responses.  Additionally, I generated a cost-benefit matrix and profit curve to estimate the profitability of the campaign.
